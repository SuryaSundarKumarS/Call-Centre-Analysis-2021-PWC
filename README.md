#Conclusion:

1) Total Calls was highest for Streaming followed by Technical Support and Payment related. So we need to intimate our client to rectify the bugs if present and need to make interface much easier to understand and ask them to make the content encoded properly to avoid the problems with the streaming server also make payment gateway to accept payments in all modes.
2) Same measures to be taken in the case of calls not resolved for topics Streaming, Payment Related and Contract Related. Also the SOP need to be perfectly studied by the agents to give the customers a perfect resolution.
3) 40% of the calls are not satisfied. Better to take feedback from the customers to get a better understanding.
4) We can appreciate our agents for giving resolution faster, Because they are providing solution within a minute.
5) Monday and Saturday are Peak Days and 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM, 2:30 PM - 03:30PM are Peak Hours for a day so we need to prepare the roaster break according to that. Also January is a Peak Month we are having more calls because it is the vacation time and users might increase at that time.
